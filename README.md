ibus-braille
====================

<b>Braille input method for ibus </b>


ibus-braille is an ibus input engine based on six key approach of braille. We express our gratitude to Indic project & Swathanthra Malayalam Computing(SMC) for mentoring this project. We consider the acceptance of this project by Swathanthra Malayalam Computing and Google as a new flowering of the effort of louis braille. By default it uses letters f, d, s, j, k, and l in the keyboard to represent 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the braille dots respectively. One can use different combinations of braille to produce text. For example key 'f' will produce 'a', 'f' and 'd' will produce 'b' and 'f' and 'j' will produce 'c' and like. The combination of keys should be released together fafter pressing them.

	
<b>Languages : -</b> This version comes with  seven languages English, Malayalam, Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, French, and Spanish.
English is the default language, and one can switch to other languages by pressing language switch key (Pause Break). one can go back to previus language using the same key. One can select the required languages by checking them in general page of ibus-braille-preferences. Also default language can be change by using the combo box that appears in the same page.


<b>Contractions : -</b> All the grade 2 and grade 3 contractions in English and Malayalam is available in ibus-braille.

letters after pressing the contraction key, Dot 5, 5-6, 4-5-6, 4, 3, 3-6, 6, 3, 1-5-6 are the contraction signs.
For example, press 'f' and 'd' together after pressing 'j' will produce word "better" and like. Along with these contractions,
we have provided some contractions in the simple mode itself. For this purpose we have used the combinations which
are not used for alphabets.

d, s, k, l representing 2, 3, 5, 6 of the braille dots are used for numbers that is d for 1 and d, 
s together for 2 etc. Other letters are written as in braille mode, f, k, l combination is used to produce 
underscore and this combination can be used  to produce line in any text. Numeral mode is used for handling 
mathematics.
